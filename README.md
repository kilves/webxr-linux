# webxr-linux
Repository containing my efforts in getting usable WebXR under Linux

## chromium
The `chromium/` folder contains WIP patches to get Chromium's OpenXR based WebXR implementation to compile under Linux. See the README at [chromium/](chromium/) for more details. **Incomplete and _not_ functional!**

## gecko
The `gecko/` folder contains a patch to get WebXR working in Firefox under Linux (X11) using OpenVR (SteamVR). See the README at [gecko/](gecko/) for more details.
